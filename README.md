First -- this app does NOT:
1. Focus much on styling.
2. Have the cleanest code.

This repo was originally built as a quick study on how to implement API calls in React. 

The basic functionality of this JS/React app revolves around:
1. Using React's useEffect to manage state.
2. Using a promise-based API call to retrievd data from a 3rd-party API.
3. Using the result of that API call to populate information on the page.

This is by no means a complex app, but is representative of how I have chosen to self-instruct myself as a software engineer-- taking information in bite-sized chunks and implementing them in actual projects.
